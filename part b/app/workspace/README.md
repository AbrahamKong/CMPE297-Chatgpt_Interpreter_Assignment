To implement this API, we will use Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. We will also use the uuid, bson, random, and string libraries to generate the different types of IDs. 

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask app and the routes for our API.

2. `id_generator.py`: This file will contain the `IDGenerator` class, which will have methods for generating each type of ID.

3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python packages that our application depends on.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
